# Ananya Desai — Project Portfolio

This repository serves as a verification hub for the technical projects listed on my resume.
All projects are developed independently unless otherwise stated.

## Projects

### Secure Flight Data Analyzer (READY)
A Python-based tool that integrates live aviation APIs to analyze flight routes and delays and flag unusual patterns.  
Repo: https://github.com/ananyasacademics/secure-flight-log-analyzer

### Offline Blood Donation Coordination App (IN PROGRESS - STEP / Science Fair, March 6)
Offline-first mobile application designed to coordinate blood donors in low-connectivity environments. 
The app supports local data storage, bulk CSV import/export, multilingual interfaces, and SMS/call workflows to enable rapid donor matching without internet access.

Status: MVP development in progress. Repository will be made public with documentation, screenshots, and demo after submission.

### Hospital Privacy Risk Simulation (IN PROGRESS - Regional Science Fair, March 6)
Research-focused project modeling hospital access logs to study insider privacy risks and early breach detection. The project uses synthetic data to simulate realistic
access behavior and evaluates rule-based and machine learning approaches (e.g., anomaly detection, logistic regression) using precision/recall and ROC-AUC metrics.

Status: Active development. Code and results will be published after science fair submission to ensure completeness and clarity.

### Genomic Data Pipeline Security Analysis (IN PROGRESS - ETA: Summer)
Research-in-progress project analyzing privacy and access risks across genomic data workflows (FASTQ → BAM → VCF). 
The focus is on threat modeling, system-level risks, and mitigation strategies rather than implementation or deployment.
- Pipeline mapping and data flow analysis
- Threat modeling and access risk identification
- Documentation of assumptions and security tradeoffs
- No real genomic data is used in this repository

Status: Exploratory Research in progress
