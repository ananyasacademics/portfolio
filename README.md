# Ananya Desai — Project Portfolio
This repository contains technical projects I have built independently to explore cybersecurity, data analysis, and system design.
Each project emphasizes learning how real-world systems work through prototypes and simulations rather than production deployments.

## Projects
### Secure Flight Data Analyzer (Completed)
A Python-based project built to explore how flight data can be analyzed safely and transparently. 
The project uses publicly accessible API's and simulated or non-sensitive data to identify unusual patterns in flight behavior, with an emphasis on explainable, rule-based and statistical methods. 

Repo: https://github.com/ananyasacademics/secure-flight-log-analyzer

### Offline Blood Donation Coordination App (IN PROGRESS - STEP / Science Fair, March 6)
An offline-first mobile app designed to support blood donation coordination in low-connectivity environments. The project focuses on system design challenges such as local data storage, CSV-based data exchange, multilingual support, and SMS/call workflows for rapid donor matching without continuous internet access.

Status: MVP development in progress. 
Repository will be made public with documentation, screenshots, and demo after submission.

### Hospital Privacy Risk Simulation (IN PROGRESS - Regional Science Fair, March 6)
A research-focused project modeling hospital access logs to study insider privacy risks and early warning signals for inappropriate access. Using synthetic data, the project simulates realistic access behavior and explores rule-based and basic statistical approaches to anomaly detection to understand tradeoffs between sensitivity, false positives, and transparency.

Status: Active development. 
Repository will be made public with cde and results after science fair submission to ensure completeness and clarity.

### Genomic Data Pipeline Security Analysis (IN PROGRESS, Summer)
An exploratory research project analyzing privacy and access risks across genomic data workflows (FASTQ → BAM → VCF). 
The focus is on understanding system-level risks, threat modeling, and security tradeoffs rather than implementing full pipelines.

- Pipeline and data flow mapping
- Threat modeling and access risk identification
- Documentation of assumptions and design tradeoffs
- No real genomic data is used
- 
Status: Exploratory Research in progress.
